# Terrain's three ported contracts, made checkable (manifest item 1,
# specs/SPEC.md §5; kogaki#14 umbrella, kogaki#17 story 1.8).
#
# Validates every Terrain survey record (*.terrain-survey.json, anywhere in
# the tree) against specs/spec-terrain/survey-schema.json — the single
# carrier, whose field lists this check READS rather than restates:
#   1. completeness is a COVER counted in placements — every Strand placed,
#      no-relation Strands in an explicit named section, nothing silently
#      dropped (SPEC.md §2.1);
#   2. the figure is counted AFTER composition, over placements, recomputed
#      here from the placements themselves, and it NAMES which family it
#      counted — a bare count is a defect (SPEC.md §2.1);
#   3. navigation state carries no narrowing key — sections gate nothing
#      (SPEC.md §2.2/§2.3); a narrowing key in a survey record is the
#      refused minimal-form bundling arriving as a field.
# Plus: every record carries the pin the seam returned (SPEC.md §3).
#
# Schema v2 (kogaki#26/#27, story 1.22) extends the same three contracts to
# SPEC.md §5's candidate model and §9's family-named figures — no new contract
# and no new admission, since this check is already registered with its
# admission record and removal signal and its loop position is unchanged:
#   - rows are LESSONS ONLY and a Journey is a MARK on its Lesson's row
#     (CANDIDATE_NOT_A_LESSON);
#   - a Journey matching no Lesson is falsifier 1 and refuses the record
#     (JOURNEY_ORPHAN, §5.2 — a generation-time refusal, mirrored here);
#   - the per-section family split lives in the RECORD and is recomputed from
#     the placements it claims to count, refused on mismatch through the
#     EXISTING FIGURE_MISMATCH path (the fill of
#     `deferred-slot: terrain-family-split-carrier` with alternative (a),
#     owner decision 2026-08-06, SPEC.md §9).
# The recompute algorithm below is the SECOND copy — terrain/terrain.mjs
# familySplit is the first. §9 records that the single-carrier clause covers
# survey-schema.json's field lists and NOT this algorithm, and that (a)
# extends both halves; collapsing them is not licensed.
#
# What this check does NOT carry is stated in its own output: whether the
# grouping axis serves the owner, whether section names are honest, and
# whether a proposal's narrowing was worth ratifying are JUDGMENTS and route
# to the review lane (kogaki#13, story 1.5). An unstated omission reads as
# coverage. Terrain's runtime applies these same rules BEFORE writing
# (terrain/terrain.mjs validateSurvey) — this check is the detection half
# behind that constrained generation, and the fixture pass is the evidence
# both halves discriminate.
#
# Reporting obeys the three-part remedy: guard the crash, report a crash AS
# a crash (CANNOT-DETERMINE, never a finding), disclose repetition.
