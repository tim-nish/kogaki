# check-brief-compose — the composition-side refusals kogaki#1225 added, and
# the derivations it retired, asserted over the pure validator and by
# absence over the carriers (owner decision 2026-09-29).
#
# HISTORY. A member of this name ran the compose → review → assemble → adopt
# sitting end to end and was removed under the 2026-09-25 retention rule
# (kogaki#1194). This file is NOT that member returning: it is a LIGHT
# member — pure validator calls and text reads, no model run, no runtime
# spawn — that carries exactly the assertions kogaki#1225 registers and
# nothing of the removed member's coverage.
#
# WHAT THIS COVERS.
#   (a) `validateLegs` (src/compose.mjs) refuses a path whose Reader start
#       contains a term a Leg lists under `introduces:`, naming the term and
#       the Leg — the one deterministic refusal in Reader start's content:
#       whether the reader "already knows" a term is judgment, but a Leg's
#       own `introduces:` entry is the composer's declaration that they do
#       not, and a declaration can be read.
#   (b) the same path with the term absent from Reader start is NOT refused
#       on that ground — whatever else the minimal fixture is refused for is
#       a different refusal, and the assertion is on the ground, not on a
#       pass: the fixture Leg is deliberately minimal so the introduced-term
#       clause, which runs before the per-Leg shape loop, is the only clause
#       that can name `introduces`.
#   (c) the match is WHOLE-WORD and case-insensitive: "check" is not found in
#       "checks", "Check" is found in "a check ran", a one-character term
#       matches only standing alone, and the anchor after the `—` separator
#       is not part of the term.
#   (d) `openingQuestionOf` is no longer exported from src/compose.mjs — no
#       Opening question is read off the first Leg any more.
#   (e) by absence over the carriers: `readers/dev-to-zenn.md`'s `reader`
#       field carries no purpose clause ("to fix or avoid"), and
#       `src/differentiation-schema.json`'s `question:` line derives nothing
#       from why the reader opened the post.
#   (f) the Thesis Closure row reaches only the Reader target Leg
#       (kogaki#1229, renamed under kogaki#1231): `targetLegIds`
#       (src/assemble.mjs) names the Leg marked `reaches_target` alone, and
#       `closureRowsForLeg` (src/compose.mjs), read over a Closure section
#       whose Thesis row names that Leg, hands the row to that Leg's Packet
#       and to no earlier Leg's. Before kogaki#1229 the row named every Leg,
#       so every Packet carried the whole path's closure narrative.
#   (g) `readerTargetLegRefusal` (src/compose.mjs) refuses a path carrying
#       zero, or more than one, Leg marked `reaches_target`, and refuses one
#       marking the first Leg — naming the rule (kogaki#1231).
#   (h) a closing Leg (any Leg after the one marked `reaches_target`)
#       carrying an `introduces` entry, or named `introduced_by` on a
#       Closure row, is refused naming the Leg and the rule (kogaki#1231).
#   (i) a closing Leg whose `reader_state_after` orientation or knowledge
#       line differs from the target Leg's is refused naming the Leg and the
#       rule; the same closing Leg with only its question, expectation or
#       trust line differing is NOT refused (kogaki#1231).
#   (j) the derivation: `targetLegAfterState` (src/assemble.mjs) reads the
#       marked Leg's `reader_state_after`, line for line, regardless of its
#       position in the path (kogaki#1231, reversing kogaki#1225's last-Leg
#       derivation).
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER, stated rather than left to look covered: whether
# a Reader start is a GOOD cold read of the Thesis as a title, and whether
# its `question:` line is this reader's reaction to the wording they saw,
# are judgments read by the owner against the Brief and linted nowhere
# (Every MUST is judgment). What a closing Leg does with terms the reader
# already holds, and the Thesis-row leak under the retired last-Leg
# derivation, are separate proposals (kogaki#1231's own scope note), not
# here. The retired `reader_target` derivation and the removed `Opening
# question` heading are covered by check-brief-differentiation.sh's
# kogaki#1225 half, not here.
