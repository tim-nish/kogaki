# The mechanical review trigger (specs/SPEC.md §4 PR-gate clause, kogaki#34
# item 2; story 1.13, licensed by kogaki#37).
#
# WHY A SWEEP AND NOT A GITHUB ACTION. The transport was chosen against three
# facts about this environment rather than from the menu, and all three rule
# the Actions option out:
#
#   1. The repository holds no Actions secret, so no CI-hosted agent can
#      authenticate today.
#   2. The gateway's location is MACHINE-LOCAL CONFIGURATION and "never a
#      committed path" (kogaki#9) — it resolves through --gateway,
#      $TSUREZURE_GATEWAY_JS, or the machine's own MCP registration. A CI
#      runner has none of those and cannot be given one without committing a
#      path the founding decision forbids.
#   3. §4 now makes an UNSCOPED TIER-1 SURVEY the review's fixed opening move.
#      A reviewer that cannot reach the seam fails that clause on EVERY run,
#      so an Actions-hosted lane would be structurally degraded rather than
#      occasionally so.
#
# So the trigger runs where the seam is. A spawned session satisfies the
# isolation requirement BY CONSTRUCTION — a fresh reviewer holds none of the
# author's context — which is what makes a mechanical trigger the right
# carrier rather than merely a convenient one.
#
# WHAT FIRES THIS TOOL — AN EVENT, NEVER A TIMER (kogaki#47). The periodic
# timer this file originally recommended is REJECTED: a timer forces the
# user to wait for the next tick, and "a mechanism is not correct merely
# because it behaves according to its own internal rules — if the user
# experience is bad, it is a mechanism built on an incorrect design"
# (consulted: product-lab@ed47fbd3 topics/archive/articles.md:29); a trigger
# binds to "an act that ALREADY HAPPENS … never as a periodic reader"
# (topics/knowledge-architecture.md:9). The acts that change the review
# substrate are `gh pr create` and `git push`, and the project-scoped hook
# (.claude/hooks/review-trigger.py, wired in .claude/settings.json) fires
# this tool in SINGLE-TARGET mode (--pr N / --branch B), detached, at those
# acts. The full sweep remains as MANUAL RECONCILIATION only — for PRs
# created outside a hooked session — and the presence check stays the loud
# backstop either way: an unreviewed PR cannot merge.
#
# The three environment facts above rule out ACTIONS-HOSTED review; they
# never ruled out event-driven local invocation, and reading them as if
# they did was the defect kogaki#48 generalized (a decline spent past its
# boundary).
#
# SPAWNING IS OPT-IN. --dry-run is the default: the sweep reports what it
# would do and mutates nothing. Spawning a session is an outward act, so it
# needs an explicit --spawn rather than a flag someone forgets is on.
